        2. **Body Dysmorphic Disorder** - Jai has significant preoccupation with his appearance and body image
        3. **Major Depressive Episode** - Jai exhibits low mood, withdrawal, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities

        - No evidence of conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder

        - No evidence of psychotic symptoms or bipolar disorder
        - While Jai has experienced trauma from cyberbullying, symptoms don't meet full PTSD criteria
